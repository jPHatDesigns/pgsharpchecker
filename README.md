## How It Works

1. The app reads your installed Pokemon Go version from the package manager
2. It scrapes pgsharp.com to get the latest Pokemon Go version that PGSharp supports
3. Compares the two versions and notifies you if they differ
4. Runs automatic checks in the background every 12 hours (optional)
